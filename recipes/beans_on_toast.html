<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="desc">This <strong>big</strong> beans on toast recipe is actually my own creation.
I underwent a serious gym journey a few years ago, back in 2021. I had decided that
I'd had enough of being skinny, and wanted to put on some serious size. I got myself
a personal trainer and started increasing my food intake.</p>
<p class="desc"> The biggest challenge I had was breakfast. I found it difficult to think of a 
    meal I could eat in the morning which gave me the calories I needed.
    Then I decided, I'd just make a <em>massive</em> beans on toast. Here's the recipe.
    Good luck eating this in one sitting!
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="even">3 thick slices of bread</li>
    <li>1 tin baked beans</li>
    <li class="even">4 slices of cooked turkey</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheese (I used vegan due to my dairy allergy)</li>
    <li class="even">Some hot sauce for flavour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li class="even">Pop the 3 slices of bread in the toaster, toast to preference.</li>
    <li>Heat the baked beans on a medium-low heat for 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li class="even">Add a few dashes of hot sauce to the beans, to taste.</li>
    <li>Once everything is heated/toasted, time to plate up!</li>
    <li class="even">Lay down the toast first, and butter each slice. Then pour the beans over
        evenly. </li>
    <li>Next, lay the slices of cheese over the beans.</li>
    <li class="even">Lay the slices of turkey on top of the cheese. Then finally, a few more dashes
        of hot sauce to finish!</li>
</ol>
